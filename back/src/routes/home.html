          <b>This Week In Neovim</b> is a hand-crafted weekly newsletter gathering everything that has happened in the past
          week around Neovim Core and in the Neovim Plugin ecosystem. Each weekly news is then separated into two main
          categories: <b>Core</b> and <b>Plugins</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="block has-text-justified">
          The <b>Core</b> part is about the changes in Neovim itself, whether it is about the nightly (main development branch) or the public stable
          release.
        </p>

        <p class="block has-text-justified">
          The <b>Plugin</b> part is the result of skimming main communication sources, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim">Reddit</a>,
          various GitHub projects, embedded help Neovim manuals and others. It is also a contribution-based process where people can open PRs and issues
          to contribute their findings.
        </p>
